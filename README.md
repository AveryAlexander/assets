As it stands, the curlme.sh file is gonna serve myself as a way to quickly reinstall my favorite packages on fresh installs of Debian on a regular basis. Could also end up a a menu where i host more things in the future, who knows.

Also using this repo as a testing ground for myself to learn about git and github
